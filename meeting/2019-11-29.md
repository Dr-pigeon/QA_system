1.Competition PPT. We finished the APP competition on 27th Nov,2019. And we make a video to show our chatting robot. The presentation PPT has already upload to this github. In these competition we use this chatting robot to manage the electricity use in UM and won the first prize. Besides text response, the robot can also return a graph to show the tendency of electricity use during some time.

Discussion: 
1.About the mini program.The design of the front end of our applet has been relatively simple. After the competition is completed, the professor hopes that we will do some special effects design on the front end to better improve the user experience. For example, the dialog box no longer uses the usual direct display method, but uses a pop-up form similar to siri to display the sentence, so that the user feels strange and updated.  
2.Add a dataset about free chatting in our QA dataset. Because now we change to use the searching system i developed to answer those questions which don't contained in our QA dataset. So for those free chat questions, UMor will return some offcial answer but actually, the user maybe want to chat with the robot. Such as the image i showed. Then Derek ask us to find some dataset about free chat. So UMor can chat with user.

3.With the dataset become larger, the speed of UMor answer the question become slower. I did a test before. If the question is in our dataset, UMor can return answer for 0~2s, if the question is not in our dataset, UMor will find the answer on the internet for 4~6s. So we decide to train a model to return the index of the answer. And then we can find the answer very quickly.
