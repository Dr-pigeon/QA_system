Finished: 
1. Finished the functions required by the question in the app design competition: the competition required us to finished check, compare,
visualize and predict the electricity consumption data. We develop a new program about electricty functions in our server, because some of
these functions are not necessary in UMor. We will delete them after this competition.

2. UI developed: Firstly, we finished more detail about the applet such as the gap in the bottom of the UI and some problem about displaying user avator. Secondly, for this competition, we decide something new in the UI. One is setting the limitation electricity using and the other is checking the electricty reading value real time.

3. Do some research about time extract and develop a program about it. Since when user ask about the electricity functions or news functions, they will contain time information which we need to used to locate the date. For instance, people ask '明天下午3点到4点E11的用电量是多少？'， we need to analyse the question and extract the time information ' 2019-11-23T15:00:00' and '2019-11-23T16:00:00'. Then use it to do the electricity consumption prediction.

4. Dataset. We keep on collecting question and answer dataset by user log. And we collect some question about electricty consumption system to match user asking format easily and accuracy.
