Finished:   
1.Finished the functions required by the question in the app design competition: the competition required us to finished check, compare,
visualize and predict the electricity consumption data. We develop a new program about electricty functions in our server, because some of these functions are not necessary in UMor. We will delete them after this competition.

2.UI developed: Firstly, we finished more detail about the applet such as the gap in the bottom of the UI and some problem about displaying user avator. Secondly, for this competition, we decide something new in the UI. One is setting the limitation electricity using and the other is checking the electricty reading value real time.

3.Do some research about time extract and develop a program about it. Since when user ask about the electricity functions or news functions, they will contain time information which we need to used to locate the date. For instance, people ask '明天下午3点到4点E11的用电量是多少？'， we need to analyse the question and extract the time information ' 2019-11-23T15:00:00' and '2019-11-23T16:00:00'. Then use it to do the electricity consumption prediction.

4.Dataset. We keep on collecting question and answer dataset by user log. And we collect some question about electricty consumption system to match user asking format easily and accuracy.    
Discussion:   
1.The competition presentation PPT. We showed the PPT to Prof.Wong and ask for some advice. He required us to talk more about the chatting robot without focusing too much on wechat applet and algorithm. Because our system is wished to develop as UM chatting robot, we need to introduce its role and use. Besides, because we just have 10 minutes to present, it would better to make a 1 minute video to show how the robot interact with people. 
2.LOGO. Prof.Wong think the LOGO we designed last time can be used for now. But if we develop this system well and people begin to use it. We must decide a better LOGO which can express the UM chatting robot meaning in simple and clear method. 
3.The monitoring chart. We add a chart to monitor electricity consumption in different buildings. Prof.Wong advice us to use sparkline to replace the Histogram because sparkline not only can represent the data real time but also can represent the data change in the past few hours.  
Chanllenge:   
1.The wechat program doesn't have sparkline component, so we need to search and find some methods to replace the component to achieve the same effect.  
2.The UM power consumption API update very quickly, we need to develop a program to catch the data every one hour and clean the data in our server.  
3.The QG generation system has less research in Chinese, and we don't have too much achievement about that. We need to keep on finding more research to learn.  
Schedule:   
1.We plan to have next meeting on 11.29 after the comeptition presentation.   
Appendix:   
I upload the wechat applet QR code about our chatting robot on the github, if anyone want to help us test it, you can scan the QR code. And if you have any advice for us, you can just talk to the robot. We will be thankful for that!
