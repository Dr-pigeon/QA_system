Attendence: CHEN GUANHUA  
Finished: 
1.Multi-classification model. Actually, this was finished before chrismas vacation. But after the exam, my professor had something to go out of school, so we only reported to the professor in January. In last meeting, we discussed about using a index searching algorithm to replace the original sequences similarity methods. So we developed a multi-classification nerual network to do the index searching. It will be more quick than calculating similarity for each two sentences. This model use 'softmax' function to transform the output into 0 to 1.Because one sentence just belong to one class, so all the sum of all outputs will be 1. And we find the answer index according to the largest output which means highest probability. But we still not updated this model to replace the old one in our server because we need to test more about its accuracy.I will updated it in my server as soon as possible. And i will show the model performance test result in the next meeting note.  
2.Umor can query English words and do the calculation in chinese.

Discussion:   
1.About dataset. Since our dataset is still not large enough. We have totally 3000 QA data now about UM. But we think if we only collect the QA data in log from our friend user, it will be very slow.So we consider two methods to improve it. The first one is find some open source dataset and then add our UM QA data into it to train a QA model. That will be more smart and quickly. The second method is Question Generation.I did a little research about QG before and i designed a program which can generate question about '谁'，'哪里','什么时候' types of question from sentences based on Semantic Analysis. But since at that time,we focus on building system, then we stoped it. And now we want to do more research about it.And try to use it to generate question from UM news or events which can be added into our dataset. But this time, we won't only focus on chinese. We will also read some paper about QG in english.  
2.Speech Recognition and Speech synthesis. Because we hope to develop a chatbot like human as soon as possible. So we want to make the chatbot can answer people in speech and it will enhance user experience.Of course,if people can ask question in speech ,it will be better than input words. At first, we consider to use BAIDU API to achieve these functions.But as you know, those API have limitation.Then we plan to train one by ourselves.But we didn't do any research about these two aera before.So we need to read some papers and find some open source data and model to have a try.   
3.UI. Our front end mini program is roughly completed. And now we want to add a liitle function.We hope to get user's feedback after answering each question. So we will add a question after each answer like '答案是否有效？' and let user choose 'yes' or 'no'.Then we can know whether the answer works for the problem.Becasuse sometime user will ask some questions which are not in our dataset, and UMor will find the answer on the Internet.And we can decide whether add this question and answer pair into our dataset according to the feedback.Then next time when user asks this question, UMor don't need to find on the Internet which will take more time.  
Challenge:  
1.I think the most challenging part in our tasks in this meeting is QG system.Because i did some research about it before. It didn't have a good performance in non-general sentence.Most of researches have good performance in general question generation like 'who','what','when','where'.But if the sentence contains too much information not related to the trunk，the model won't work. As for speech recognition, the researches about it is relatively complete.   
Schedule：   
1. I decide to have another meeting with prof.Wong before vacation.
