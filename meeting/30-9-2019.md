Attendees: CHEN GUANHUA, LI JUNFEI  
Finished items: 
Since that is the first meeting of our group with professor, so we mainly focus on how to start the project and what we have done is just
collecting some QA data.  
Discussion:   
First, we talk about how to build a QA system. We plan to use cosine similarity with large scale of dataset to build a basic QA system first and we will change better algorithm after we finshed building all the system. Secondly, we will use python program to develop the QA system and make a server for the chatting robot in our lab.Finally,we plan to desgin a logo for our UMor chatting robot and we will develop a wechat applet for it as the front end.  
Challenges:   
Since there is no any QA dataset of UM before, we need to collect the data by ourselves. And we want to use google search enginee to answer open domain question because we can't promise that user will just ask questions about UM. But before we finished it, we will use TULING chatting robot to replace it. 
Schedule: We plan to meet professor again on Oct,10th or Oct,11th to report our works.

(Since this is the first meeting, so we don't have too much meeting notes because we just know about the project details and how to start it.)
