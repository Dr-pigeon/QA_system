1.Competition PPT. We finished the APP competition on 27th Nov,2019. And we make a video to show our chatting robot. The presentation PPT has already upload to this github. In these competition we use this chatting robot to manage the electricity use in UM and won the first prize. Besides text response, the robot can also return a graph to show the tendency of electricity use during some time.

2.New avator.Because Derek think the old avator is not good enough.So we design a new avator.

Discussion:   
1.About the mini program.The design of the front end of our applet has been relatively simple. After the competition is completed, the professor hopes that we will do some special effects design on the front end to better improve the user experience. For example, the dialog box no longer uses the usual direct display method, but uses a pop-up form similar to siri to display the sentence, so that the user feels strange and updated.  
2.Add a dataset about free chatting in our QA dataset. Because now we change to use the searching system i developed to answer those questions which don't contained in our QA dataset. So for those free chat questions, UMor will return some offcial answer but actually, the user maybe want to chat with the robot. Such as the image i showed. Then Derek ask us to find some dataset about free chat. So UMor can chat with user.

3.With the dataset become larger, the speed of UMor answer the question become slower. I did a test before. If the question is in our dataset, UMor can return answer for 0 to 2s.If the question is not in our dataset, UMor will find the answer on the internet for 4 to 6s. So we decide to train a model to return the index of the answer. And then we can find the answer very quickly.  
Challenge:  
1.We need to find some research paper about searching and QA to choose one method to improve UMor answer speed. Because our dataset is still not large enough even though we add the free chat dataset. So we worry about the accuracy if we use the dataset to train a QA system model directly which means the model will output a answer sentence. That's why we consider use searching model to get the index of the answer. It transform a answer generation model to a classification task and it will be easy to complete.   
2.Some friends give feedback to us that the campus bus information is not accuracy sometime. So i decide to get some data and try to make a algorithm to improve the bus arrival time accuracy.   
Schedule:   
1.Because we begin final exam, we plan to arrange next meeting after the end of final exam.
